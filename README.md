# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To identify the most in-demand skills for the top three most popular data roles, I first determined which data roles appeared most frequently in job postings. I then filtered the dataset to include only those roles and extracted the top five skills associated with each one.

This analysis highlights the most popular data job titles along with their most commonly requested skills. It helps identify which skills to prioritize depending on the specific role I am targeting.
